# TezJS

Tezos JavaScript API

* `npm run build` - produces production version of your library under the `lib` folder
* `npm run dev` - produces development version of your library and runs a watcher
* `npm run test` - well ... it runs the tests :)
* `npm run test:watch` - same as above but in a watch mode

### To embed it in html page
Import the library using : `<script src="tez.js"></script>`
Then you can use the library by calling __tez__ like `var wallet = tez.account.create();`
